# Recommender System

This is a Proof of Concept (POC) where a Recommendation System based on Autoencoders is created. The algorithm utilizes a database containing the purchase history of various customers (i.e., different products they have bought). Subsequently, the model infers the recommended purchases for each of these customers as well as for new clients who are to be introduced into the database.
